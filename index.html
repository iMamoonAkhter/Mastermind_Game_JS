      Rules of Mastermind Game
    </h1>
    <ul class="mouseover">
      <li>
        The game is played with a decoding board consisting of a hidden code and
        a series of rows for guesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        The hidden code is composed of four pegs, each of which can be one of
        six colors: blue, green, red, yellow, orange, or pink.
      </li>
      <li>
        The objective of the game is to guess the exact colors and positions of
        the four pegs in the hidden code.
      </li>
      <li>Players have up to 11 attempts to guess the hidden code.</li>
      <li>
        After each guess, the player receives feedback in the form of small
        pegs:
        <ul>
          <li>A red peg indicates a correct color in the correct position.</li>
          <li>A white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position.</li>
          <li>No peg indicates an incorrect color.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The feedback pegs do not correspond to the positions of the guessed
        pegs; they only indicate how many colors are correct and in the correct
        or incorrect positions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The game continues until the player guesses the hidden code correctly or
        runs out of attempts.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the player guesses the code correctly, they win and the hidden code
        is revealed.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the player does not guess the code within the given attempts, the
        game is lost and the hidden code is revealed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The game can be played by one player against the computer or by two
        players taking turns setting and guessing the code.

          Mastermind is a classic code-breaking game where one player sets a
          secret code, and the other player tries to guess it within a certain
          number of attempts. The code is a sequence of colored pegs, and after
          each guess, the code-setter provides feedback indicating how many pegs
          are the correct color and in the correct position. The challenge is to
          crack the code using logic and deduction before running out of
          guesses. It's a fun and engaging game that tests your strategic
          thinking and problem-solving skills!

        Mastermind is a classic board game of logic and deduction. It was
        invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and
        telecommunications expert. The game challenges players to crack a hidden
        code, typically consisting of a sequence of colored pegs, using
        deduction and logic within a limited number of guesses.
      </p>

      <h1 class="mt-2"><i>History</i></h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Mastermind was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli
        postmaster and telecommunications expert. After presenting the idea to
        major toy companies and showing it at the Nuremberg International Toy
        Fair, it was picked up by a plastics company, Invicta Plastics, based
        near Leicester, UK. Invicta purchased all the rights to the game and the
        founder, Edward Jones-Fenleigh, refined the game further. It was
        released in 1971–2.
        <br />
        The game is based on a paper and pencil game called Bulls and Cows. A
        computer adaptation was run in the 1960s on Cambridge University’s Titan
        computer system, where it was called 'MOO'. This version was written by
        Frank King. Other versions were written for the TSS/8 time sharing
        system by J.S. Felton, for Unix by Ken Thompson, and for the Multics
        system at MIT by Jerrold Grochow.
        <br />
        Since 1971, the rights to Mastermind have been held by Invicta Plastics.
        (Invicta always named the game Master Mind.) They originally
        manufactured it themselves, though they have since licensed its
        manufacture to Hasbro worldwide, with the exception of Pressman Toys and
        Orda Industries who have the manufacturing rights to the United States
        and Israel, respectively. Chieftain Products acquired the rights to
        manufacture in Canada in 1972, though they went out of business in 1996.
        <br />
        Starting in 1973, the game box featured a photograph of a man in a suit
        jacket seated in the foreground, with a young woman standing behind him.
        The two amateur models (Bill Woodward and Cecilia Fung) reunited in June
        2003 to pose for another publicity photo.

        <h1>GamePlay Rules</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>The game is played using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four
            large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows
            containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
          </li>
          <li>
            Code pegs of six different colors (or more; see Variations below),
            with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the
            board; and
          </li>
          <li>
            Key pegs, some colored (red in the image, though often black) and
            some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs;
            they will be placed in the small holes on the board.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which
          must be an even number. One player becomes the codemaker, the other
          the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs.
          Players decide in advance whether duplicates and blanks are allowed.
          If so, the codemaker may choose up to four same-colored code pegs or
          four blanks. If blanks are not allowed in the code, the codebreaker
          may not use blanks in their guesses. The codemaker places the chosen
          pattern in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the
          codemaker but not to the codebreaker.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color,
          within eight to twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of
          code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides
          feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of
          the row with the guess. A colored key peg is placed for each code peg
          from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white
          key peg indicates a code peg that belongs in the solution, but is
          incorrectly positioned.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If there are duplicate colors in the guess, they cannot all be awarded
          a key peg unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate
          colors in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is
          red-red-blue-blue and the codebreaker guesses red-red-red-blue, the
          codemaker will award three colored key pegs for the first two reds and
          the blue, but nothing for the third red. No indication is given of the
          fact that the code also includes a second blue.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback
          continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly,
          or all rows on the decoding board are full.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Traditionally, players can only earn points when playing as the
          codemaker. The codemaker gets one point for each guess the codebreaker
          makes. An extra point is earned by the codemaker if the codebreaker is
          unable to guess the exact pattern within the given number of turns.
          (An alternative is to score based on the number of key pegs placed.)
          The winner is the one who has the most points after the agreed-upon
          number of games are played.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Other rules may be specified.</p>
